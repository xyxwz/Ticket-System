# Ticket System API

Express API for the Ticket System.


## Authentication

Currently using [TxSSC-Passport](https://github.com/TxSSC/passport-txssc), but this will be changed to another generic [passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy in the future.
The Ticket-System has a RESTful JSON api. It uses a token based authentication to sign request in the X-Auth-Token header.
